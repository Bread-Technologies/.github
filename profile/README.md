## 🚀 Mission

> **Bread** gives people greater control over AI.

Today’s language models are static, one-size-fits-all, and centralized. We’re building open tools to break that paradigm. Bread delivers cloud and open-source systems enabling **precise, versioned, and composable** updates—at the weight level—of LLMs. You can teach, refine, or update a model just by describing what you want, in natural language, as easily as correcting a friend.

**Why?**
- Machine learning shouldn’t be locked behind a PhD.
- You shouldn’t need specialist teams or corporate buy-in to adjust model behavior.
- Everyone should be able to build, adapt, and own intelligence that works their way.

We’re fundamentally against centralization of AI control, and we believe adaptive, iterative teaching—by *demonstration*, *question/answer*, and *practice with feedback*—makes models both more useful and more human-aligned.

> **No “AI priesthood.” No static black-boxes.** Only intelligence you can *teach*.

## 🥖 What’s in this Org? <!-- A little fun emoji goes a long way for readability -->

- **⚡️ [aibread SDK](https://libraries.io/npm/@aibread%2Fsdk)**  
  *Official JavaScript/TypeScript SDK to interact with our cloud API and run prompt bakes. Composable edits, dependency tracking, and more.*

- **🗃️ [aibread·mcp](https://libraries.io/npm/@aibread%2Fmcp)**  
  *“Multipurpose Control Panel” microserver. User-friendly abstraction around the SDK for orchestrating model edits, chaining bakes, and collaborative workflows.*

- **🌱 [aibread·bgit](https://libraries.io/npm/@aibread%2Fbgit)**  
  *Git-style “branch & merge” versioning for machine learning artifacts. Bring order and clarity to LLM weight changes.*

- **🐍 [PyPI: aibread](https://libraries.io/pypi/aibread)**  
  *Python tools for editing and composing model behaviors (early availability, more OSS tools “coming soon”).*

## 💡 Key Features

- **Composable LLM “baking”:** Stack, chain, and recompose model edits as easily as merging branches.
- **Natural language weight editing:** Edit and update model behavior using instructions and feedback, no deep learning expertise needed.
- **Open and modular:** Connect with our cloud or (soon) self-host open tools for surgical model versioning.
- **Decentralized control:** Bread is fundamentally committed to empowering everyone to adapt, teach, and own AI.

> 💬 *Want open-source libraries? More OSS tools are coming soon—stay tuned!*
