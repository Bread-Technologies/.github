## 🚀 About

> Our mission is to give **you** greater control over your AI.

Today’s language models are static, one-size-fits-all, and centralized. We’re building tools to break that paradigm. Bread delivers cloud and open-source systems enabling **precise, versioned, and composable** updates—at the weight level—of LLMs. You can teach, refine, or update a model just by describing what you want, in natural language, as easily as correcting a friend.

**Why?**
- You shouldn't need a PhD in ML to train an AI.
- You shouldn’t need specialist teams or corporate buy-in to adjust model behavior.
- Everyone should be able to build, adapt, and own intelligence that works their way.

We believe adaptive, iterative teaching—by *demonstration*, *question/answer*, and *practice with feedback*—makes models both more useful and more human-aligned.

<br/>

## Where to start?

1. **[Create an account](https://aibread.com/login)** and get an API key
2. **[Bake your first model](https://github.com/Bread-Technologies/Bread-SDK-Bake-Repo)** with our SDK
3. **[Read our documentation](https://docs.bread.com.ai)** to learn more
